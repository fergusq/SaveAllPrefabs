# Save all prefabs

This mod currently adds a lot of stuff, including the roads, to the editor hierarchy. You can use this to create custom road asset packs etc.

## Creating custom roads

* Enable the mod in the settings
* Go to the editor.
* Select "Edit prefab" and choose any road.
* Click "Duplicate template". This will create a new prefab for you to edit.
* Set the name of the prefab to something recognizable. This will be the name of the asset in the code, and it will not be visible to the user. Avoid special characters such as "/".
* Select "Add Object" and build your new road so you can see what you do.
* Go back to "Edit prefab" and at the very top of the sidebar, you can edit the sections, i.e. the lanes of the road. Add and remove any lanes, medians, sidewalks, tracks, etc.
* When you are satisfied, find your road from the hierarchy and click the save button.
* The prefab will be saved to AppData\LocalLow\Colossal Order\Cities Skylines II\StreamingData~
* Restart the game after adding the new assets before using them
