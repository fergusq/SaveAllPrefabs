# Save all prefabs

This mod allows you to save roads and other "non-object" prefabs created in the editor. You can easily make custom roads with any lanes you want. The prefabs will appear in the hierarchy at the top left with a save button. You can use this to create custom road asset packs etc.

## Features

* Adds all prefabs to the hierarchy (so that they can be saved)
* Adds Net Sections, Net Pieces, and Net Lanes categories to the prefab list

## Creating custom roads

* Enable the mod in the settings. **The current version of the mod needs to be enabled before it does anything.**
* Go to the editor.
* Select "Edit prefab" and choose any road.
* Click "Duplicate template". This will create a new prefab for you to edit.
* Set the name of the prefab to something recognizable. This will be the name of the asset in the code, and it will not be visible to the user. Avoid special characters such as "/".
* Select "Add Object" and build your new road so you can see what you do.
* Go back to "Edit prefab" and at the very top of the sidebar, you can edit the sections, i.e. the lanes of the road. Add and remove any lanes, medians, sidewalks, tracks, etc.
* When you are satisfied, find your road from the hierarchy and click the save button.
* The prefab will be saved to AppData\LocalLow\Colossal Order\Cities Skylines II\StreamingData~
* Restart the game after adding the new assets before using them

Thanks to StarQ for fixing a bug in the mod.
